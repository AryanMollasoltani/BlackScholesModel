# Black-Scholes option pricing Model

Underlying Model Assumptions:
1. Constant volatility + No jumps in price
2. The underlying asset follows a Geometric brownian motion 
3. No extra transaction fees
4. The option is European 
5. The returns are assumed to follow a normal distribution

The derivation of the model is not discussed. The focus of this project is on implementation. 

The next models worked on will be:

- The binomial pricing model 
- Models using stochastic volatility
